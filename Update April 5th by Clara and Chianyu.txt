Update: April 5th by Clara and Chianyu
bomberman can now place bomb, and destroy crates
	bomb will explode after 2 seconds
	bomberman now cannot place another bomb until the first one explodes
	we want to stop bomberman from passing through the bomb, we started to implemented it but not yet finish
		we will upload once we complete the code

in "select level" sub menu, we can now select levels, each level has its own map
	we have created an array of maps in the texture class
	each mouse event in the selectLevel class gives a value to levelNum
	and the init() loads the map according to levelNum
	however, for the moment being, the "play" is disabled, which needs to be fixed
		(we feel it's unncessary to have this option since it functions as selecting level 1 in "select level" menu)

bugs we found:
+ the bomb can destroy crate even if there is a block in between (after we increase the range)
+ level select button, we can only click on the lower right corner, or else it will go directly to level 2
	(we think it's because the "select level" button overlaps with "level 2" button...)

questions:
+ what happens to the bomberman if it gets hit? does it go to its initial position or stays at its current position?
+ what is the condition for level completion? (e.g. destroy all the AI/crates etc.?)
